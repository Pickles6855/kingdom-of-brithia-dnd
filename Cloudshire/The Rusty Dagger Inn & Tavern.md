"The Rusty Dagger" is a dilapidated building with a sagging roof and peeling paint, giving it a weathered and neglected appearance. The sign above the entrance hangs crookedly, its once vibrant colors faded by years of exposure to the elements. A flickering lantern casts a dim light over the entrance, barely illuminating the overgrown path that leads to the door. Despite its shabby exterior, the faint sounds of raucous laughter and clinking tankards can be heard from within, hinting at the lively atmosphere that awaits inside.

Stepping inside, patrons are greeted by a dimly lit interior that exudes a musty smell of stale ale and old wood. The tavern is sparsely furnished with rickety tables and chairs, their surfaces scarred and stained from years of use. A threadbare rug covers the uneven floorboards, and cobwebs cling to the rafters overhead. The bar itself is a battered and stained affair, with shelves lined haphazardly with dusty bottles and chipped mugs. Despite its unkempt appearance, the tavern is filled with the rough-and-tumble energy of adventurers and travelers seeking respite from the road.

The barkeep of "The Rusty Dagger" is a grizzled and surly character known simply as Old Jeb. With a face weathered by years of hard living and a voice like gravel, he has little patience for nonsense and even less for those who try to skip out on their tab. Despite his rough exterior, Old Jeb has a certain charm that endears him to the regulars, and his tales of wild adventures and narrow escapes are legendary among those who frequent the tavern.

The menu at "The Rusty Dagger" is limited to cheap and greasy fare, with offerings such as stale bread, watery stew, and questionable cuts of meat that are best avoided by those with discerning palates.

The rooms upstairs are no better, with lumpy mattresses and thin blankets providing little comfort to weary travelers. The walls are paper-thin, and the creaky floorboards offer little privacy, making for a restless night's sleep for those unlucky enough to stay the night.
